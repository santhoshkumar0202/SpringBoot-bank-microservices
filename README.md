#Bank Project
##Eazy Bank is a modern financial application designed to demonstrate the implementation of microservices architecture using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and various other cloud-native technologies. It consists of several services such as loan-service, card-service, account-service, and infrastructure components like config-server and gateway, orchestrated using Kubernetes and Helm.

##Features
loan-service, card-service, account-service: Individual microservices for handling different banking capabilities.
config-server: Centralized configuration management for microservices.
gateway: API Gateway for request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
helm: Package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying deployment scripts.
kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations.
##Documentation
Microservices are documented using Open API Specification and Swagger to provide a clear contract and interactive API docs.

##Architecture
The microservices are sized and bounded contextually to ensure a domain-driven design. Docker plays a crucial role in containerization, creating lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application.

##Docker Compose
Used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, it allows us to manage the lifecycle of containers running our microservices.

##Cloud Native and 15 Factor Methodology
The application adheres to cloud-native principles and the comprehensive 15-factor methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.

##Resilience
Resilience is built into the microservices using the RESILIENCE4J framework, providing fault tolerance and handling.

##Observability and Monitoring
Implemented using the Prometheus stack with Loki, Promtail, Tempo, and Grafana for deep insights and real-time monitoring of microservices.

##Security
Microservices are secured with OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Spring Security, ensuring robust authentication and authorization.

##Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven microservices with RabbitMQ, Kafka, Spring Cloud Functions, and Spring Cloud Stream provide asynchronicity and decoupled communication.

##Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine
Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, and GCP's Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling applications.

Helm
Helm simplifies Kubernetes application deployment by managing Kubernetes manifest files.

Commands Reference
A list of most commonly used Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm commands is provided to manage the lifecycle of the application.
